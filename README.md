![screenshot 1](./github-media/1.webp)

a painterly vector playground with jelly motion, brush-based shapes, and interactive effects  
inspired by excalidraw, miro, figma  

demo -- https://brushie.vercel.app/

initially planned as a proper high-performancewhiteboard/vector editor  
but after implementing fundamental features i realized that wanna gamify it a bit and take a deeper dive into shaders  
so dont measure the performance here hahahah  

the app is not about productivity but just vibing  
planned to create a proper 1-2 minute experience by turning it into a game but maaaybe not   
also syncing became not a priority cuz of that, didnt test that well
there are a lot of bugs and missing features, look at the [notes](#notes). also use project search for "TODO:". and left some "NOTE:" comments

use it as a realworld vue3+threejs+glsl+yjs example or as a reference app -- you can see the [documentation](#how-to-understand-the-code-for-devs) below, hope it helps üíûü§ò
why threejs and not pixijs? well... forgot that it existed xD

glad to any PRs and feel free to ask any questions on linkedin/telegram„ÄÇ thanks for the star and support!

## features
### ‚ú® core drawing
- draw with pencil, lines, rectangles -- brush-based + painterly
- draft mode for line/arrow with real-time preview before creation
- radial menu on right click: pick color, delete shape
- shape transformations: move, resize, rotate with bounding box handles
- clipboard support: copy & paste shapes with ctrl/cmd + c/v
- undo/redo system (ctrl/cmd + z/y)
- multi-select by dragging
- interactive eraser
- dynamic grid dots (zoom dependent)
### üéÆ game mode
- click on shapes to interact with them
- destroy shapes stroke-by-stroke with juicy particles
- reactive jelly motion and stroke animation
### üíª ui/ux
- painterly materials with custom fragment/vertex shaders
- inertial UI with floaty toolbars
- zoom and pan with scroll and modifiers
- tooltip hints on hover
- separate overlay canvas for selections, cursors, bounding boxes
- post-processing and mesh highlight for subtle visual feedback
- velocity-based jelly deformation
### üß† internals & architecture
- quadtree-based shape lookup for fast hit detection
- modular feature-based architecture (not strict FSD)
- canvas rendered with three.js + raw glsl shaders (custom materials for a background, for painterly+jelly shapes, and for particles)
### üß™ debug tools
- debug canvas menu (memory, fps, draw calls, vertex count, mesh count). disabled by default
### üåê collaboration & sync
- multiplayer sync with yjs
- remote cursors and selections
- network provider switch: websocket or webrtc
- undo/redo across clients
- shape locking & awareness system
### üíæ persistence & pwa
- persistent shape storage in indexeddb
- offline support and pwa integration
- save/load from browser cache

## how to use (for users)
- draw shapes using tools in the top-left corner
- resize, move, rotate
- right-click a shape to access radial menu (color, delete)
- drag to select multiple
- ctrl/cmd + z/y to undo/redo
- scroll to zoom, ctrl/shift/cmd + scroll to pan
- hover on a button to see a tooltip
- game mode allows interaction with rect shapes (click to emit particles and remove shape stroke by stroke)

## how to understand the code (for devs)
used modular feature-based architecture

<details>
<summary>modules/features reference</summary>

### editor

- `editor-core`  
  base visual components and rendering (3d canvas, debug, materials, shaders)  
  hooks for animations, camera control, effects, rendering, zooming

- `editor-game`  
  game mode mechanics, layer logic, and interactive shape gameplay. in a very wip shape  
  and actually making it as a game would require some arch changes  
  to prevent fundamental editor features be tightly coupled with game logic

- `editor-input`  
  user input handling: mouse, 3d tools, cursors

- `editor-shapes`  
  all about shapes: radial menu, hooks for creating, editing, finding, selecting, clipboard, draft, bounding box

- `editor-ui`  
  canvas ui components (container, toolbar) and hooks for tool management. and inertial ui (its looking very fun!!!)

- `editor-sync`  
  yjs syncing integration, network providers (webrtc/websocket), remote cursors, locked shapes, drafts, undo/redo support

### shared
- shared constants, hooks, services (quadtree), shaders, types
- and a couple of ui components -- menu, button, tooltip

### math
- helper utils for geometry, lerp, transforms, easing

### pwa
- progressive web app support

## notes
planned a lot more but realized wanna do something else. took ~2-3 weeks

bugs: 
- recreating line draft and cuz of that seeing material recreation every time
- fix multiple pencils in one position click detection (make click transparent?)
- undo/redo after shape moving - not working
- undo action removes many shapes at once (groups them?)
- do not save drafts in indexeddb
- wrong bounding box if another user moving a line

important todo:
- use https://shihn.ca/posts/2020/resizing-rotated-elements/ for resize rotated
- update shape color sync + saveShapeDB
- useEraserDraft - sync erasedIDs. and if was erasing and pressed escape at the same time then it doesnt removing draft shape on another client
- recheck offline

not important/planned for the future:
- shape z-index layers
- shape customization
- shape draft
- useShapeSelection - lasso selection
- useToolManager - custom tools
- useOverlayCanvas - multitouch
- useZoom - sync zoom like figma
- usePencilDraft - pressure, color lineWidth
- useBoundingBox - snap
- render - instanced mesh
- usePencilDraft - excalidraw drawing
- add vr support
- add text tool
- proper game mode (spawn new shape with timer ?)
